PreProcessor for NLP
=============

Python package that provides a comprehensive toolkit for pre-processing texual data.

Usage
--------
Install the package using pip:
```bash
pip install text_preprocessor
```

Then, add the package to your python script and call appropriate functions:

```python
from text_preprocessor import PreProcessor

# Create an instance of the PreProcessor class
preprocessor = PreProcessor()

# Preprocess text using individual methods
input_text = 'Hello, my name is Joe Bloggs and my email address is joe.bloggs@email.com'

preprocessed_text = preprocessor.remove_email_addresses(input_text)

print(preprocessed_text)

'hello, my name is Joe Bloggs and my email address is <EMAIL_ADDRESS>.'
```

You can also chain together multiple preprocessing methods and run them all as a pipeline. 
There is a default pipeline that features some of the most common / standard preprocessing tasks.
Or you can create your own custom pipeline.

Note: Pipelines are configured to automatically give preference to string methods, however, this
feature can be overridden to preserve the order in which methods were added to the pipeline.

```python
# Preprocess text using default pipeline
input_text = 'Hello, my name is Joe Bloggs and my email address is joe.bloggs@email.com'

pipeline = preprocessor.create_pipeline(load_defaults=True)

result = preprocessor.execute_pipeline(input_text, pipeline)

print(result)

{'processed_text': ['this is a sample sentence now would you like another one'], 'exceptions_list': []}
```

The output of the pipeline is a dictionary that contains the processed text and an exceptions list. The latter 
contains a list of any methods that failed to run. To access the text simply unmarshall the dictionary as follows:

```python
print(result["processed_text"])

['this is a sample sentence now would you like another one']
```

If the default pipeline does not meet your specific needs, it is easy to create a custom pipeline.

```python
# Preprocess text using custom pipeline 
pipeline = create_pipeline()

pipeline.add_methods([
  preprocessor.make_lowercase,
  preprocessor.remove_whitespace,
  preprocessor.remove_email_addresses
  preprocessor.handle_line_feeds
])


input_text = "  Hello, my name is Joe Bloggs and my email address is joe.bloggs@email.com\r\n  '

result = preprocessor.execute_pipeline(input_text)                                        

print(result["preprocessed_text"])

'output to be added'
```
