# Text PreProcessor for NLP

This Python package provides a comprehensive toolkit for pre-processing texual data for use in Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects.

## Usage

Install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install text_preprocessor
```

Once the package is installed, add it to your script and call appropriate functions:

```python
from text_preprocessor import PreProcessor

# Create an instance of the PreProcessor class
preprocessor = PreProcessor()

# Preprocess text using individual methods
input_text = 'Hello, my name is Joe Bloggs and my email address is joe.bloggs@email.com'

preprocessed_text = preprocessor.remove_email_addresses(input_text)

print(preprocessed_text)

'Hello, my name is Joe Bloggs and my email address is <EMAIL_ADDRESS>.'
```

You can also chain together multiple preprocessing methods and run them all as a pipeline.
There is a default pipeline that features some of the most common / standard preprocessing tasks.
Or you can create your own custom pipeline.

Note: Pipelines are configured to automatically give preference to string methods, however, this
feature can be overridden to preserve the order in which methods were added to the pipeline.

```python
# Preprocess text using default pipeline
input_text = 'Hello, my name is Joe Bloggs and my email address is joe.bloggs@email.com'

preprocessor = PreProcessor(default_pipeline=True)

result = preprocessor.execute_pipeline(input_text)

print(result)

'this is a sample sentence now would you like another one'
```

If the default pipeline does not meet your specific needs, it is easy to create a custom pipeline.

```python
# Preprocess text using custom pipeline
pipeline.add_methods([
  preprocessor.make_lowercase,
  preprocessor.remove_whitespace,
  preprocessor.remove_email_addresses
  preprocessor.handle_line_feeds
])

input_text = "  Hello, my name is Joe Bloggs and my email address is joe.bloggs@email.com\r\n  "

result = preprocessor.execute_pipeline(input_text)

print(result)

'hello, my name is joe bloggs and my email address is <EMAIL_ADDRESS>'
```
